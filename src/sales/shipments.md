The Shipments grid lists the shipment record of all invoices that have been prepared for shipping. A shipment record can be generated when an order is [invoiced]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sales/invoices.md %}), or later.

Magento supports partial and complete order shipment, with additional options depending on [Inventory Management]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link catalog/inventory.md %}), [Magento Shipping]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link shipping/magento-shipping.md %}), and third party extensions.
