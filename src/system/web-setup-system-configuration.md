If your Magento installation is hosted on Adobe Commerce Cloud, see [Install, manage, and upgrade extensions][1].

Your Marketplace access key is used to synchronize your Magento installation with your Magento Marketplace account. After the services are synchronized, you can add extensions, modules, and components using the Web Setup Wizard in the Admin of your store. The services remain in sync so you can easily install extensions, as well as keep track of all extensions that you purchase and install.
