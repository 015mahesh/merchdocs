In many countries, the state, province, or region is a required part of a postal address. The information is used for shipping and billing information, to calculate tax rates, and so on. For countries where the state is not required, the field can be omitted entirely from the address, or included as an optional field.

Because standard address formats vary from one country to another, you can also edit the template that is used to format the address for invoices, packing slips, and shipping labels.
