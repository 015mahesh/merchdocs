As a security measure, the Admin is initially set to time out after 900 seconds, or fifteen minutes of keyboard inactivity. However, you can adjust the lifetime of the session to fit your work style.

## To set the session lifetime:

1. On the Admin sidebar, choose **Stores**. Then under **Settings**, choose **Configuration**.

1. In the panel on the left under **Advanced**, choose **Admin**.

1. Expand ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}){: .Inline} the **Security** section.

1. In the **Admin Session Lifetime (seconds)** field, enter the number of seconds that a session remains active before it times out.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link images/images/config-advanced-admin-security.png %}){: .zoom}
    _[Security]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link configuration/advanced/admin.md %})_

1. When complete, tap <span class="btn">Save Config</span>.
