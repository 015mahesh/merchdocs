title: Amazon Pay Customer Experience
---


Customers can speed through checkout by using the payment methods and shipping addresses that are available in their Amazon accounts. Your store can be configured to show the Amazon Pay button on [product pages]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link quick-tour/product-page.md %}), and in the [cart sidebar]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sales/cart-sidebar.md %}), [shopping cart]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sales/cart.md %}), and during [checkout]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sales/checkout-step1-shipping.md %}).

For international customers, they may also have an option to select their preferred currency if you list prices in more than one currency. This multi-currency support allows customers to complete purchases without worrying about currency conversions or rates.
