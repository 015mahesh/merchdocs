title: Recommendation Limitations
path: product-recommendations

As we continue to evolve this technology and ensure you are successful in implementing product recommendations, it is critical that we are clear about any limitations to this technology. The following lists features that are not supported at this time:

1. Currency conversion - If multiple store views have localized currencies, the recommendations served on storefronts will be in base currency. How you have your currency configured in your catalog will be how your currency will appear in your recommendation unit. A workaround is to only show products without pricing.

1. Product recommendations do not support customer grouped pricing. They support regular and special pricing at this time. See [advanced pricing]({% link catalog/pricing-advanced.md %}) for more information.

1. Product recommendations do not support bundled and grouped products. These products will not be shown in a recommendation unit.

1. Category permissions - if customers or segments only have visibility to certain categories or products they will only have access to certain products available to them. WE ASSUME EVERYONE CAN SEE EVERYTHING.
