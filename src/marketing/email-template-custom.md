title: Customizing Email Templates
---

Magento includes a default email template for the body section of each message that is sent by the system. The template for the body content is combined with the [header]({% link marketing/email-template-header.md -%}) and [footer]({% link marketing/email-template-footer.md -%}) templates to create the complete message. The content is formatted with HTML and CSS, and can be easily edited, and customized by adding [variables]({% link marketing/variables.md -%}) and [widgets]({% link cms/widgets.md -%}). Email templates can be customized for each website, store, or store view. Make sure to update the system configuration after creating a customized template, so the custom template is used instead of the default.

The default templates include your logo and store information, and can be used without further customization. However as a best practice, you should view each template, and make any necessary changes before they are sent to customers.
