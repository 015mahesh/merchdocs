Marketing Automation is a cloud-based tool powered by dotmailer that produces professional, personalized email communications and reports using data from your Magento store.

Dotmailer gives you the ability to:

* Create customized email communications
* Import contacts
* Schedule campaigns
* Create rules to add logic and automate your campaigns

## Changes In the Latest Release

* You can now request and capture the consent of customers and guests using dotmailerâ€™s new Consent Insight.
* You can import only those Magento contacts who have opted in (customer subscribers, guest subscribers, and other subscribers).
* A warning alerts you when you are about to sync non-subscribers into a dotmailer account.
* Improvements have been made to the retry process that results after a failed attempt to access EDC.
