title: Calculating Recommendation Performance
---

To analyze how well your recommendations are performing, Magento collects the following metrics:

* **Impressions** - Number of times the Recommendations widget was rendered on the page. Note that the recommendation can be rendered but not within the viewport of the shopper's browser.

* **Views** - Number of times the Recommendations widget appeared in the viewport of the shopper's browser. Magento counts this as having been viewed by the user.

* **Clicks** - Number of times shoppers clicked on an item in the Recommendations widget.

* **Viewability %** - Number of **Views** divided by the number of **Impressions** for the Recommendation widget.

* **Click-through rate (CTR) %** - Number of **Clicks** divided by the number of **Views** for the Recommendation widget.

* **Revenue** - Revenue driven by a recommendation. Revenue is calculated by the total value of the items purchased (including tax) after clicking on a product from the Recommendations widget.
