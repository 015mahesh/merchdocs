title: Recommendation Metrics
---

To analyze how well your recommendations are performing, Magento collects the following metrics:

- **Impressions** - Number of Recommendation units that were rendered on the page. Note that the recommendation can be rendered but not within the viewport of the shopper's browser.

- **Viewable Impressions** - Number of Recommendation units that appeared in the viewport of the shopper's browser. Magento counts this as being viewable.

- **Clicks** - Number of units that were clicked.

- **Viewability %** - Number of **Views** divided by the number of **Impressions** for the Recommendation unit.

- **Click-through rate (CTR) %** - Number of **Clicks** divided by the number of **Views** for the Recommendation unit.

- **Revenue** - Revenue driven by a recommendation. Revenue is calculated by the total value of the items purchased (including tax) after clicking on a product from the Recommendations unit.
