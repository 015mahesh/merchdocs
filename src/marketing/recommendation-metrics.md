To analyze how well your recommendations are performing, Magento collects the following metrics:

-  **Impressions** - Number of times a Recommendation unit is loaded and rendered on a page. Note that the recommendation can be rendered on a page but not viewed by the shopper; for example, a Recommendation unit can be loaded “below the fold” of the browser’s viewport. In this case, the rendered unit would be counted as an impression, but a view would only be counted if the user scrolled the unit into view.

-  **Views** - Number of Recommendation units that appear in the viewport of the shopper's browser. This metric is triggered as soon as 50% of the unit scrolls into view.

-  **Clicks** - Number of times a shopper clicks an item in a Recommendation unit.

-  **Viewability %** - Percentage of Recommendation unit impressions that register a view.

-  **Click-through rate (CTR) %** - Percentage of Recommendation unit impressions that register a click.

-  **Revenue** - Revenue driven by a Recommendation. Revenue is calculated by the total value of items that were clicked on in a Recommendation unit and ultimately purchased.
