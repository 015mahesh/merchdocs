By default, products that appear in upcoming or closed events are not available for general sale, and the Add to Cart button does not appear on the product list or product page.

To restore the Add to Cart button for a closed event, the event must be deleted. However, if a product is associated with another category that has no selling restrictions, the Add to Cart button does appear on the product page. Similarly, the ticker block does not appear on the product page if the product is associated with another category that has no selling restrictions.
