title: More like this
---

The _More like this_ recommendation type recommends items based on similar content and attributes to the product being viewed.

## How it works

By evaluating the attributes for the products being viewed or in a cart or on the confirmation page, _More like this_ recommends other similar products within those product categories. For example, if a shopper is browsing yoga mats, the _More like this_ recommendation type recommends other products within the equipment category. Because _More like this_ does not currently distinguish between genders, this recommendation type is not recommended for clothing stores.

### Where used
