DEPRECATED: [Page Builder]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link cms/page-builder.md %})â€™s advanced content tools replace the previous banner functionality as described in this topic. We keep this content in the user guide as a convenience for those whose stores have customizations that prevent them from using Page Builder.

A [banner]({{ site.baseurl }}{%- link cms/banners.md -%}) can target a specific [customer segment]({{ site.baseurl }}{%- link marketing/customer-segments.md -%}), and be incorporated into a [cart price rule]({{ site.baseurl }}{%- link marketing/price-rules-cart.md -%}). Because customer segments are dynamic, the price rule can adjust to changes in customer activity.
