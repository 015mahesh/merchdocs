title: Product Reviews
---

Product reviews help to build a sense of community, and are considered more credible than any advertising money can buy. In fact, some search engines give sites with product reviews a higher ranking than those without. For those who find your site by searching for a specific product, a product review is essentially the landing page of your store. Product reviews help people find your store, keep them engaged, and often lead to sales.

The configuration determines whether customers must open an account with your store before writing product reviews, or if they can submit reviews as guests. Requiring reviewers to open an account prevents anonymous submissions, and improves the quality of reviews.

*Add Your Review*

Customers can write reviews for any product in your catalog. Reviews can be written from the product page by clicking the “Add Your Review” link. For products that haven't been reviewed, the link says, “Be the first to review this product”. The Reviews tab lists all current reviews, and the form that is used to submit a review.

The number of stars indicates the satisfaction rating. Visitors can click the link to read the reviews and write their own. As an incentive, customers can receive reward points for submitting a review. When a review is submitted, it is sent to the Admin for moderation. When approved, the review is published in your store.
