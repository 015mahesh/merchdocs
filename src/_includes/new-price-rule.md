Price rules are automatically processed with other system rules. How often this processing happens depends on your installation's [cron configuration]({{ page.baseurl }}/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-cron.html). When you create a new price rule, allow enough time for it to get into the system. Then, test the rule to make sure that it works correctly.
