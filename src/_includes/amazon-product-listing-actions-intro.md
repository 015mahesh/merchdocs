The Product Listing Actions section defines how your catalog interacts with Amazon. These settings include:

- Indicate if your Magento catalog products that meet Amazon eligibility requirements are automatically sent to your Amazon Seller Central account to create new listings.

- Set the default handling time for an order. This value defines the number of days generally required for you to process and ship an order. For example, if someone selects 2-day shipping, that shipping transit time does not start until processing completes and packages are handed off to a carrier. The total delivery time is (handling time + transit time + any holidays).
