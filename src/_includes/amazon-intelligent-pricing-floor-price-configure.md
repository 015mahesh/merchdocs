Define your lowest price setting in the **Floor Price** section.

1. For **Floor Price Source**, select an attribute from the drop-down.

   Select your Magento attribute that will indicate your relative floor limit. For example, if you donâ€™t want your product listing price to go below the Cost of your item, you would choose the Cost attribute.

1. For **Floor Price Action**, select an option.

    - **Decrease By**: Choose when you want the defined Floor Price Source value to be adjusted down, creating a lower floor price for the rule, before listing to Amazon.

    - **Increase By**: Choose when you want the defined Floor Price Source value to be adjusted up, creating a higher floor price for the rule, before listing to Amazon.

    - **Match**: Choose when you do not want the listing price to fluctuate below the defined Floor Price Source value. When set to `Match`, the **Apply** and **Floor Adjustment Amount** fields are disabled.

1. The **Apply** field defaults to `Apply as percentage`.

1. For **Floor Adjustment Price**, enter the numerical value for the percent to adjust your Floor Price Source.
