**Disabled feature:** 
Magento backup is disabled by default. To enable may require developer assistance. See Magento DevDocs for the command to enable backups: [Back up and roll back the file system, media, and database][1].

**Deprecation Notice!** 
Magento backup features are deprecated as of v2.3.0. We recommend that all merchants investigate additional backup technologies and binary backup tools (such as Percona XtraBackup).
