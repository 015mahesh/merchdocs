title: Reduce Ordering Errors
---

[Streamlined Order Process]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sales/point-of-purchase.md %})
:  [Quick Order]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sales/quick-order.md %})
reduces the process to several clicks. Magento offers multiple ways to configure the [shopping cart]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sales/cart-configuration.md %}) and [checkout process]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sales/checkout-configuration.md %}), to eliminate manual data entry, and reduce costly ordering errors.

[Assisted Sales]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sales/shopping-assistance.md %})
:  Assign a dedicated sales rep to each company account, who can access the customer’s shopping cart in real time, and offer personal assistance over the phone.

[Complete Inventory Visibility][1]
:  Add [Magento Order Management][1]{: target="_blank"} for complete inventory visibility with accurate, real-time inventory levels from all locations and supply chain partners. Drop-ship scheduled deliveries, and track inventory across multiple warehouse locations.

[SKU and Inventory Validation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sales/point-of-purchase.md %})
:  Magento reduces ordering errors by automatically verifying the SKU and availability of all items before an order is submitted. Merchants can set the [out of stock threshold]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link catalog/inventory-configure-inventory-management.md %}) for each product, set backorder levels, and manage the messaging that appears in the storefront.

[Custom Catalogs and Price Lists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link catalog/catalog-shared.md %})
: Maintain different “shared” catalogs with custom pricing for specific companies.

[Bulk Orders]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link customers/account-dashboard-order-by-sku.md %})
:  Create bulk pricing tiers with per-unit costs and discounts according to order size. Buyers can [reorder]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link customers/account-dashboard-my-orders.md %}) from previous orders, or upload order data directly to the shopping cart.
