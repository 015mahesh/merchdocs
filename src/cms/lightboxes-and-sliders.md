title: Adding a Lightbox or Slider
---

In Magento Commerce, it is easy to add a [slider]({% link cms/page-builder-media-slider.md %}) to your store with [Page Builder]({% link cms/page-builder.md %}). The slider can be set to play automatically, or controlled manually with navigation buttons.

There is also a wide assortment of jQuery-based image lightboxes, sliders, and carousels available on [Magento Marketplace][1], and some are free.
