The Advanced Pricing settings define the conditions required for special pricing that is available for a specific customer group{% if "Default.B2B Only" contains site.edition %} or shared catalog{% endif %}. Advanced Pricing can be applied to simple, virtual, downloadable, and bundle products. To apply discounted pricing to other product types, use a [catalog price rule]({% link marketing/price-rules-catalog.md %}). To learn more, see [Price Scope]({% link catalog/catalog-price-scope.md %}).

Advanced pricing data is synchronized with product pages{% if "Default.B2B Only" contains site.edition %} and shared catalogs{% endif %}. For example, if you update a tier price quantity, the system updates the value {% if "Default.B2B Only" contains site.edition %}in the shared catalog and {% endif %} on the product page. {% if "Default.B2B Only" contains site.edition %}Any custom pricing that is indicated in the shared catalog has priority over customer group pricing.{% endif %}
