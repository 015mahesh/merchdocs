title: Creating Products
---

Choosing a product type is one of the first things you must do to create a new product. In this section, you will learn how to create a product of each type. In addition to the basic product types, the term, complex product is sometimes used to refer to products with multiple options, such as a configurable product that is available in various colors and sizes. To learn more about the available options, see [Product Settings]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link catalog/settings.md %}) and [Advanced Settings]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link catalog/settings-advanced.md %}).

If you are just starting out, you can create a few sample products to experiment with each product type. For a deeper understanding, make sure to read about catalog [navigation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link catalog/navigation.md %}), how to set up [categories]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link catalog/categories.md %}) and [attributes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link stores/attributes-product.md %}), and the catalog [URL options]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link catalog/catalog-urls.md %}) that are available to you.

After you learn the basics, the most efficient way to add a large number of products to the catalog is to [import]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link system/data-import.md %}) them from a CSV file.
