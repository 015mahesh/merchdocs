title: Grouped Product
---

A grouped product consists of simple standalone products that are presented as a group. You can offer variations of a single product, or group them by season or theme. Presenting a grouped product can create an incentive for customers to purchase additional items. A grouped product provides an easy way to offer variations of a product, and list them all on the same page.

For example, you might sell open stock flatware, and list every type of utensil that is used in a formal place setting. Some might order multiple salad forks, fish forks, dinner forks, dinner knives, fish knives, butter knives, soup spoons, and dessert spoons. Other customers might order a simple fork, knife, and spoon. Customers can order as many of each item as they want.

Although they are presented as a group, each product in the group is purchased as a separate item. In the shopping cart, each item and the quantity purchased appears a separate line item.

The following instructions take you through the process of creating a grouped product using a [product template]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link stores/attribute-sets.md %}), required fields, and basic settings. Each required field is marked with a red asterisk (*). When you finish the basics, you can complete the [advanced settings]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link catalog/settings-advanced.md %}) and [other settings]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link catalog/settings-other.md %}) as needed.

## Things to Remember

* A grouped product is essentially a collection of simple associated products. 

* Each item purchased appears individually in the shopping cart, rather than as part of the group.

* The thumbnail image in the shopping cart can be set to display the image from the grouped parent product, or associated product.
