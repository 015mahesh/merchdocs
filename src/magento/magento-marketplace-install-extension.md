If your Magento installation is hosted on Adobe Commerce Cloud, see [Install, manage, and upgrade extensions][1].

Installing an extension is a three-step process that should take place during off-peak hours. Before the extension is installed, your store is put into maintenance mode, checked for readiness, and backed up. After the extension is installed, it must be configured for your store according to the developerâ€™s instructions.

For complete instructions, see [Extension Manager]({% link system/web-setup-extension-manager.md %}).
