Before you can install an extension purchased from Magento Marketplace, sign in to your Magento account and verify that you have the required access key. You can sign in to your Magento account from the header of [Marketplace][1] or [Magento.com][2].

Your access key is a set of public and private keys that are used to synchronize your store with Magento Marketplace and verify your credentials. Setting up the access key is normally a one-time process, although it can be changed at any time. Whenever you create a new access key, it must first be used to synchronize your store with Magento Marketplace. After your store is synchronized, you must enter the private key each time you install an extension or module from Magento Marketplace, or upgrade your Magento installation.

## Step 1: Create an Access Key

1. Go to [Magento.com][2] and sign in to your Magento account.

1. On the _My Account_ page, choose the **Marketplace** tab.

1. In the upper-right corner next to your name, click the down arrow and choose **My Profile**.

1. On the _Marketplace_ tab under _My Products_, click **Access Keys**. Then, do one of the following:

    - Check to see if you already have a set of access keys for your Marketplace purchases. You can create multiple sets of access keys for different purposes.

    - Click **Create a New Access Key**. Enter a name for the new key pair and click **OK**. Valid characters include upper- and lowercase characters, and hyphens instead of spaces.

1. When complete, click **OK**. Your new access key is enabled and appears in the list.

  Notice the _Copy_ link after each public and private key. In the next step, you will copy and paste these values to synchronize your store with Magento Marketplace.
