## Step 1: Create a Set of Access Keys

Before purchasing an extension, sign in to your Magento account and verify that you have an available set of access keys. Each set of access keys consists of a public and private key. A valid set of access keys is required to install any extensions or themes that you purchase from Magento Marketplace.

1. Go to [Magento.com][2] and sign in to your Magento account.

1. On the _My Account_ page, choose the **Marketplace** tab.

1. In the upper-right corner next to your name, click the down arrow and choose **My Profile**.

1. On the _Marketplace_ tab under _My Products_, click **Access Keys**. Then, do one of the following:

    - Verify that you have an available set of access keys for your Marketplace purchases. You can create multiple sets of access keys for different purposes.

    - If necessary, click **Create a New Access Key**. Enter a name for the new key pair and click **OK**. Valid characters include upper- and lowercase characters, and hyphens instead of spaces.

1. When complete, click **OK**. Your new access key is enabled and appears in the list.

Notice the _Copy_ link after each public and private key. Later when you are ready to install an extension, you will need to paste your keys to complete the process. You can return to your Magento account whenever necessary to copy them.

## Step 2: Make a Purchase

  A confirmation of your order is sent by email, with information about the purchase and links to installation instructions. From the order confirmation page, you can print a receipt, go to your account, or view the downloads that are available from your account. Your purchase also appears on the _Marketplace_ tab of your Magento account under _My Products_.

## Step 3: Install the Extension

Installing an extension is a three-step process that should take place during off-peak hours. Before the extension is installed, your store is put into maintenance mode, checked for readiness, and backed up. After the extension is installed, it must be configured for your store according to the developer’s instructions.
